        Born in Peru, lived a few years in Spain, now based in Utah. I'm a
        fullstack web developer with a background of Administration and
        Finances. I changed my career not too long ago and I finally love what I
        do! I went to DevMountain for the Web Development immersive class and I
        can say that it was an awesome experience, I learned a lot in a few time
        and worked really hard for it. I'm excited to see the challenges I will
        have as a developer and expand the skills that I already have.
